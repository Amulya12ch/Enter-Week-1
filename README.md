Project Title: Plastic Waste Detection on Land and water surfaces
This project is useful to decrease land pollution and water pollution. 
With the support of convolutional neural network model for detecting 
and classifying plastic waste in water and land. 

WEEK-2
Plastic Waste Detection using CNN | 60% Completed
This project focuses on detecting plastic waste on land and water surfaces using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Currently, 60% of the work is completed — dataset preprocessing, model building, and training have been done in Google Colab with an achieved accuracy of 98%. The next phase will include UI integration and testing with new images.
