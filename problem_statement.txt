Plastic pollution has become one of the most serious environmental challenges affecting both land and aquatic ecosystems.
Large amounts of plastic waste accumalate on soil surfaces and water bodies,harming biodiversity, degrading soil and water
quality,and disrupting agricultural and marine life.Manual monitoring of plastic waste is time-consuming,costly,and often inaccurate.

AIM:This project aims to develop a convolutinal Neural Networks(CNN)-based image classification model that can automatically detect 
and classify plastic waste present on land and water surfaces from mages. The system will assist in environmental monitoring,promote 
sustainable waste management, and support efforts toward cleaner ecosystems.
